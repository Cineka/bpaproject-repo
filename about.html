                              <p>My favorite hobbies are playing Baseball and lifting.
                                 My favorite programming language is Java because it was the first object oriented language I learned.
                                 I got into coding because of the Intro to Computer Science course I took in freshman year and 
                                 I decided to take the AP course my sophomore year.
                                 I enjoy coding random math and logic functions that do simple tasks.

                                  mostly because I have done the most with them and I know a good amount of stuff. I came to dacc without
                                 knowing anything about coding and just decent pc knowledge. My favorite thing to code is
                                  the look of a site or page iâ€™m working on. I really enjoy making and styling pages.</p>

                                I got into coding in middle school when my tech teacher showed it to me and I fell in love.
                                My favorite things to code are probably games because there are endless opportunities and it can be used by many people.

                            My favorite programming language is C# because I enjoy doing object-oriented programming
                            and I look forward to making games on Unity. I got into coding when I was in seventh grade
                            when I saw there was a computer science class and I have done a class involving programming
                            ever since. Right now my favorite thing to program is simple games, I made a number guessing 
                            game in C# and it was a lot of fun to do.
