              <p class="paraTxt">In today's world carbon emissions are extremely high in contrast to earlier dates. 
                This is due to how efficiently we made our simple day to day tasks. Such as going to work and school, or even growing plants. 
                There are many things that you can do that leave your carbon footprint on the earth. For example, 
                driving your car to work or school can release harmful gasses into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are a major contributor to carbon emissions. 
                Carbon dioxide, Methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gasses, and sulphur hexafluoride are all 
                common greenhouse gasses that are harmful to the environment. These greenhouse gases have increased the earth's average temperature 
                by trapping these harmful gases in the atmosphere. greenhouse gases have been a troubling topic recently and many of the issues with 
                carbon emissions and global warming start with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a gas that absorbs and radiates heat potentially increasing
                the average temperature of the earth and causing global warming. Just a crazy fact to know: The ocean has absorbed enough carbon dioxide to lower 
                its pH by 0.1 units, in other words a 30% increase in acidity.</p>
